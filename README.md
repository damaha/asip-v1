# asip-v1
Code for ASIP project publication, Dec. 2019.

This code is published in order for readers of our publication (forthcoming) to see how the CNN architecture was defined in Keras/Python (`model.py`).
`train.py` is guiding the user to train the model but data loader needs to be adjusted to the users own dataset.
